**Game Scoreboard API Testing Suite**

The Game Scoreboard API Testing Suite is a comprehensive project aimed at thoroughly testing the backend API responsible for managing the scoreboard functionality of a mobile game. This project encompasses creating, executing, and automating API tests using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

**Key Features**

- **API Documentation:** Detailed documentation outlining the endpoints, request methods, parameters, and expected responses for the game's scoreboard API.
- **Postman Collection:** A collection of API test cases organized into folders based on different functional areas of the scoreboard API.
- **Environment Variables:** Utilization of environment variables within Postman to manage different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Test Scripts:** Implementation of JavaScript-based test scripts within Postman to automate the execution of API tests.
- **Newman Integration:** Integration of Newman, the command-line companion for Postman, to enable automated execution of API tests.
- **Sample Reports:** Generation of sample test reports using Newman's built-in reporting capabilities.

 **Project Goals**

- Validate the functionality and performance of the game's scoreboard API across various scenarios and use cases.
- Ensure seamless integration between the game frontend and backend systems.
- Identify and address potential issues or vulnerabilities in the API implementation to enhance overall reliability and robustness.
